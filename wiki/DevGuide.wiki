=Dependencies=
The generator depends on the following libraries:
  * jdom.jar: version 1.1 of the [http://www.jdom.org/ JDOM] interface for manipulating XML files
  * velocity-1.6.4.jar: the [http://velocity.apache.org/ Velocity] templating engine
  * commons-collections-3.2.1.jar: commons libraries for collections (required by Velocity)
  * commons-io-1.4.jar: commons IO used for a bit of file system manipulations
  * commons-lang-2.5.jar: commons lang which contains the very useful StringUtils
