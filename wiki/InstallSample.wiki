= Developer requirements =
This tutorial requires at least a basic knowledge of GWT. It is recommended to complete the [http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/doc/latest/tutorial/index.html GWT tutorial] before starting this one.
= System requirements =
PhpRpcGen has been installed and tested with the following configuration:
  * GWT 2.0.4
  * PHP 5.3.1
The following step by step explanation is using [http://www.eclipse.org eclipse] and the [http://code.google.com/eclipse/index.html Google Plugin], yet *there is no dependency between PhpRpcGen and eclipse*.
= Details =
==Creating a project==
First wou need to create a GWT project.

==Cleaning the sample project==
You can then delete the following classes which contains the java source code for the default sample GWT application:
  * GreetingService
  * GreetingServiceAsync
  * GreetingServiceImpl
  * FieldVerifier

Then, open the war/WEB-INF/web.xml file and modify it so that it looks like this:
{{{
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE web-app
    PUBLIC "-//Sun Microsystems, Inc.//DTD Web Application 2.3//EN"
    "http://java.sun.com/dtd/web-app_2_3.dtd">
<web-app>
  <!-- Default page to serve -->
  <welcome-file-list>
    <welcome-file>GwtPhpRpcSample.html</welcome-file>
  </welcome-file-list>

</web-app>
}}}

Open the java class GwtPhpRpcSample and modify it (erasing most of the content) so that it looks like this:
{{{
package com.test.client;

import com.google.gwt.core.client.EntryPoint;

public class GwtPhpRpcSample implements EntryPoint {
	public void onModuleLoad() {
	}
}
}}}

You should not see any remaining error in eclipse.

==Writting the PHP RPC configuration file==

Creates a directory "rpc" at the root of the project. Then creates an XML file "config.xml" in this directory.
Your project view should now looks like this:
